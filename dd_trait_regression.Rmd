# Exploring the antecedents and utility of self-disclosure in college freshmen.

## Abstract
Adjusting to college is at once an exciting and stress-inducing process. One potentially helpful action students can take under stress is to disclose negative feelings to peers, thus enabling interpersonal emotion regulation and social support. However, students vary in their tendency to disclose negative feelings. Through trait data, social network nominations, and experience-sampling data, we explore trait and situational factors that influence studentsâ€™ likelihood of disclosing stressful events to dorm-mates. For ten days throughout their first quarter on campus, students reported up to three daily stressors, along with the emotional intensity and category for each, and to whom, if anyone, each stressor was disclosed. Academic stressors were most likely to be disclosed and social stressors least likely. Additionally, stressors higher in emotional intensity were more likely to be disclosed. Whereas students experiencing more depression, anxiety, and perceived stress were equally as likely as their peers to disclose negative events, students experiencing greater feelings of loneliness were significantly less likely to engage in self-disclosure. Interestingly, self-disclosure was not found to influence daily changes in mood, affect, or stress. Future research will aim to assess the utility of disclosure over longer timescales. Findings from this exploratory analysis can help inform whether self-disclosure should be encouraged as a potential avenue to buffering stress and improving well-being during the transition to college.

Students are most likely to disclose academic stressors to their peers and are slightly more likely than chance to disclose health-related stressors. Interestingly, students are slightly less likely than chance to disclose social stressors. Students are also more likely to disclose stressors that are higher in emotional intensity.


## How do students' individual differences influence their likelihood of disclosure?
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# add logit to fall negative events dataframe
fall_neg_dd_trait_data$loneliness_got_help_logit = predict(loneliness_got_help_model)

# convert logit to probability
fall_neg_dd_trait_data$loneliness_got_help_prob = logit_to_prob(fall_neg_dd_trait_data$loneliness_got_help_logit)

# plotting probability of disclosing negative events by loneliness
ggplot(data = fall_neg_dd_trait_data, 
       mapping = aes(x=Loneliness_avg_z, y=loneliness_got_help_prob)) + 
  # add chance line

             linetype = "dashed") +

             size = 1, 
             position  = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", 
              method.args = list(family = "binomial"), 
              se = TRUE) + 
  ggtitle("Perceived Loneliness Predicts Probability of Diclosure") + 
  # center plot title

  # rescale y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1))

```

Students who experience more loneliness are less likely than their peers to disclose stressful events, regardless of the objective number of friendships the student reports. Trait anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were also tested in separate models, but none emerged as significant predictors of disclosure.

```

Students' daily disclosure activity was used to predict satisfaction, loneliness, positive and negative affect, and stress the following day. Disclosing stress to a dorm-mate did not predict significant changes in these measures of well-being at the daily level. 

## Next Steps
* How does disclosure influence wellbeing over longer timescales (quarter, year, etc.)?
* Do qualities of the support provider, such as empathy, influence the utility of disclosing negative events?
* Why do lonely students disclose their stress less frequently?
    + How do they benefit from disclosure vs. their less lonely peers?
    + How do they perceive the impact of their disclosure on the support provider?
    + How does their IRQ-E compare to their less lonely peers?
* To what extent does IRQ-E operate as a self-fulfilling mindset?


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# 1) Look at how loneliness relates to IRQ-T and IRQ-E

# 2) **Do students high in lonliness feel better after disclosing events?
  # a) Compared to students who feel less lonlely?
  # b) **How do lonely students fare at the end of the quarter?
# 3) How do lonely students think others feel after they disclose to them?
  # a) If worse than less lonely students, could this be a potential impedence to disclosure?

# Each student was given a "vulnerability ratio," calculated by dividing the number of dorm-mates a student nominates as "providing support during difficult times" by the total number of dorm-mates a student nominates as "close friends." Although this "vulnerability ratio" does not correlate with loneliness, the individual nomination totals do. Unsurprisingly, students who nominate more dorm-mates as "close friends" report experiencing slightly less loneliness, as do students who nominate more dorm-mates as "providing support during difficult times". These two nomination totals are moderately positiviely correlated across students.
